# Linux shell
This is a project carried out in the scope of the operating systems discipline of the computer engineering course, in UBI (Universidade da Beira Interior)
Is an attempt to replicate the linux shell such as some built-in commands:
- cd (change directory)
- exit (terminate the shell)
- quemsoueu (the same as whoami)
- obterinfo (shows the shell information)
- socp (same as cp)
- socpth (same as cp but it uses threads)
- calc (calculator: calc 1 + 1)
- bits (bitwise operations)
- isjpg (says if is a jpg image or not)
- message (same as write in linux)
- <, > , | (output redirections and recursive pipes)
